It’s not as scary as you think it is.

In this article I’ll be covering some basic things you can do on the Linux terminal. I’ll be taking the Debian Linux terminal as an example, but most of these commands should work on other Linux distributions as well! So, without further ado, let’s get started.

    In Linux, everything is a file. Your directories, the devices you connect to your PC, everything.

Now let’s go over some basic directories in Linux:

. :- Current directory
.. :- The last directory
/ :- The Root directory.
/boot :- Files needed to boot the system are stored here.
/home/username :- The user’s home directory. For example, if your username is ‘user1’, your home directory will be ‘/home/user1’
/bin or /usr/bin :- Executable commands are stored here.
/etc :- Configuration files are stored here.
/mnt :- Devices you connect to your PC are mounted here by default.
/proc :- All active processes are stored here, identifiable by their Process ID’s.

Keep in mind that this isn’t an exhaustive list, but should be enough to get you started.
File operations on Linux

Moving a file to a new location:
mv file1 /path/to/destination
Moving file ‘file1’ from /tmp/dir to /tmp/dir/dir2

Moving a file to a new location & renaming it at the same time:
mv oldname /path/to/destination/newname
‘file1' was moved and renamed to ‘file01’

Renaming a file:
mv oldname newname
Renaming ‘file2’ to ‘file02'

Copying a file to a new location:
cp file /path/to/destination
Copying ‘file1’ to ‘/tmp/dir/dir2’

Listing files & directories:
$ ls
Listing directories

$ ls -l -h

    -l : Shows a detailed info of the files & directories in the current
    -h (optional) : Shows the file sizes in a more human readable format (i.e. in KB, MB, GB, etc instead of just in bytes)

Using Text editors (Vi, nano, etc):

To use ‘vi’ to edit a file ‘file.txt’:
$ vi file.txt

To do the same thing using ‘nano’:
$ nano file.txt
Running commands as root:

Let’s take an example here. Suppose you edit a configuration file in the directory ‘/etc/settings.conf’. Since /etc is a root directory, you need to get root access in order to edit this file. So, should you log out, login as ‘root’ and then edit the file?! Of course not! Instead, you just use the ‘sudo’ command to run a single command as the root user. So, in this case, the command is:

$ sudo vi /etc/settings.conf
OR
$ sudo nano /etc/settings.conf
Zipping & unzipping files

Let’s first zip 2 files (file1,file2) into a zip ‘stuff.zip’, list the contents of the zip file, and extract it.

First, the zipping part:

$ zip file1 file2 stuff.zip
zipping the files

Next, listing the contents of the zip archive:
$ unzip -l stuff.zip

    -l : Lists the zip contents

Listing the contents of the zip file

Lastly, extracting the zip archive in the current directory:
$ unzip stuff.zip
Extracting the zip contents

zip & unzip are very versatile tools that have a lot of options that you can use to do various stuff. Just run ‘zip --help’ or ‘unzip --help’ to learn about all their functions.
System Info & system stats stuff:

Uptime: To show the system uptime.
$ uptime

$ uptime -p

    -p : display the uptime in a ‘pretty’ format.

$ uptime -s

    -s : Displays the time when system was started.

The Task Manager:

htop is an amazing Task Manager that shows running processes, Memory used, Disk Usage, Network usage & more. It’s navigable using the mouse & arrow keys. To run it, simply use:
$ htop

In case it’s not installed, use:
$ apt install htop
htop

Neofetch: To display system info.
$ neofetch
neofetch

So that’s it for the basic Linux command line stuff!
